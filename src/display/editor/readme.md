I added line.js to make new line editor tat draws lines following the same logic as 
ink.js. Now, it is the same as ink.js with some edits that allow readability.
Now, the line editor looks good, I need to fix rectangle

- [ ] fix getbbox to enclose all the shape
- [x] fix deserialize to obtain a rectangle
- [ ] work on topdfcoordinates to print the correct rectangle
